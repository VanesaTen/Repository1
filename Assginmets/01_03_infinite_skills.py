If I were to gain infinite skills, I would join the world of AI. 
I believe python has a great connection to AI because it's more simpliar then C++.
Given that I have some experiance in C++, it makes it easier to understand some code. 
For example, today in class the professor asked "what does a # in python mean?"
Without knowing, I kind of assumed it was for comments. C++ has similiar methods for commenting. 
To use more than one line for a comment in C++ it's /*  */ but one comment line is //. 
In python, one comment line is # and more than one line.
