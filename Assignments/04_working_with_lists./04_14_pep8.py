Coding the same way will help make it compatible with old code. While indenting four spaces 
helps distinguish between agruements. Using space is better for indenting, you can use tabs but not 
mix them. you should try to use less then 79 characterson a line. Finally, it's important to 
comment new information for updated code because it keeps the code clean.
