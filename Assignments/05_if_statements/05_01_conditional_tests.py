"""

I'm pretty sure, that I will come across syntax errors. 
I tend to forget to add a comma or brackets. Or some type
of syntax error.

I think restricting names that are the same can be useful.
I can code the program to prevent duplicate names. 

The if, else, and elif will be useful to manage scoring
points in the game I will create.  

Ranging lists can help with structuring the winners of 
my game. I could number them from 1st to 3rd place.
