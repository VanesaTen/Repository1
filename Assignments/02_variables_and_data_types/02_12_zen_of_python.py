Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

e obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

Errors should never pass silently.
